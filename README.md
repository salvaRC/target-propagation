This an ongoing implementation of a neural network that learns via *target propagation* (instead of usual backprop), as in ["Deriving Differential Target Propagation from Iterating Approximate Inverses"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15139). <br>
It's implemented completely from scratch in Numpy (based on the [backprop version](https://github.com/salvaRC/numpy-neural-network)).
